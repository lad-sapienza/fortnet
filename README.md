# FortNet Project Website

Official website for the FortNet research project: **Fortification and population network in coastal Chaonia, Northern Epirus (Albania) between Iron Age and the Medieval period: a longue durée approach to the study of settlements, economic and defensive systems**.

This is a PRIN 2022 research project developed through a collaboration between:
- **Università di Bologna** (P.I.: Enrico Giorgi)
- **Sapienza Università di Roma** (Responsabile: Julian Bogdani)

Funded by the European Union – Next Generation EU, Mission 4 Component 1.

## About the Project

FortNet focuses on the coastal region of ancient Chaonia (Southern Albania), an area that has been relatively marginal in archaeological studies, which have primarily concentrated on larger urban sites such as Phoinike, Antigonea, and Butrint.

The project aims to:
- Provide a complete census of open and fortified sites in the coastal Chaonia region
- Create detailed topographical documentation using modern surveying technologies and geophysical methods
- Study settlement patterns, fortification networks, and population dynamics from the late Bronze Age to the Medieval period
- Build a shared web-based geodatabase for collaborative research
- Engage with local communities to balance heritage protection with territorial resource exploitation

## Website Features

This website includes:

### 📚 **Bibliography Geo Viewer**
An interactive map displaying georeferenced bibliographical sources collected by the FortNet research team. Sources are tagged with geographic coordinates, allowing users to explore scholarly literature spatially by location.

The bibliography is managed through a Zotero shared library (Group ID: 336647) which serves as the authoritative source for all project references.

### 👥 **Research Team**
