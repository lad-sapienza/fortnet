The FortNet Project is a joint collaboration between the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) and [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en) under the direction of [Enrico Giorgi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/enrico.giorgi/) and [Julian Bogdani](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/users/julianbogdaniuniroma1it), respectively, developed from [PRIN 2022](https://prin.mur.gov.it/Pages/Index/181) funding with the support of [European Union's NextGeneration EU](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/), the [Italian Ministry of University and Research](https://www.mur.gov.it/) and the [“Italia Domani” funding program](https://www.italiadomani.gov.it/).

Starting from October 2023 and for the next 24 months, FortNet will place at the centre of its research the coastal region of ancient Chaonia (Southern Albania), an area still quite marginal in current studies, mainly concentrated on the bigger urban sites such as _Phoinike_, _Antigonea_ and Butrint.

The coastal region has its own autonomy from a geographical point of view, since it is limited to the West by the rather steep Ionian coast, having few and quite difficult docking areas. The inland Acroceraunian Mountains, to use the ancient oronym, exceeding 2000 mt. of altitude, represent, on the other hand, a rather important geographical natural limit. Nonetheless, today, as in antiquity, one of the few possible routes connecting the bay of Vlora to that of Saranda passes along this ridge, while the inlands routes go through the narrow canyons created by those few streams flowing into the Ionian Sea. The sea has a double significance for a traditionally internal region such as Chaonia: it is, at the same time, both a risk factor and a connecting element. These two elements strongly determine the creation of a rather dense network of small settlements and fortifications of various types that occupy the hills overlooking the Ionian Sea.

These sites have been studied in the past very briefly, and in many cases no actual study exists or has been published. For the majority of them there is no archaeological and topographical documentation and for the rest only some sketches or rather generic descriptions are today available. The archaeological evidence seems to embrace an almost seamless long period of time that goes from the late Bronze Age to present times. For this reason, diachrony represents an essential research perspective for this project.

## Objectives

In recent years several international research projects have carried out in Chaonia, but most of all has been focused on the archaeological excavations of some important ancient cities, such as Butrint and Phoinike. However, there are numerous smaller sites, especially along the Ionian coast, that are still waiting to be fully understood, also because they lack in modern archaeological and topographical survey. These are mostly fortified settlements of various sizes, located on dominant hills, often settled for a long period, only partially known by out-of-date documentation, which have not yet been considered within a systematic project conceived with homogeneous criteria.

The FortNet Project aims to design and create an articulate geographical database, based on web technologies accessible at various levels of depth, in order to fulfil both historical-archaeological research purposes and to offer a shared tool for the protection and enhancement of the cultural heritage in a region particularly sensitive to sustainable tourism issues. While the main archaeological sites are already well integrated into the tourist circuit, the smaller ones struggle to get out of the shadow, not only in relation to large flows, but also in relation to local population, sometimes marginalised by the action of academic research: one of the main purposes regards the issue of involving local people in the processes of “production” of knowledge, and therefore of protection and enhancement of cultural heritage.

Diachrony is a second important aspect of the project. The area under examination, given the limited available data, seems to have experienced an important settlement phase at the end of the Bronze Age and during the early Iron Age. Today there are two elements that deserve particular attention in this matter: on the one hand, the almost total lack of Mycenaean finds both on the coast and along the inland routes, which completely differs from what we know, for example, for the nearby Thesprotia; on the other hand, the lack of functional tools for dating archaeological remains in those few publications dealing with this subject, which are mostly based on the comparison of construction techniques using rough stones, whose very nature makes them scarcely reliable.

The Hellenistic phase is more evident in some sites of particular interest, such as Sopot, especially when it is characterised by the construction of monumental wall circuits. Other sites, such as Panormos (probably to be identified with the bay of Porto Palermo) and Chimera (present-day Himara), are better known from historical and epigraphic sources than from their archaeological evidence. In this phase, the coastal area follows settlement dynamics that are comparable to those observed in central Chaonia. From an archaeological point of view, the Roman phase is more elusive, probably due to the progressive abandonment or depopulation of hilltop settlements, that is likely to connect to seasonal frequentation in the context of pastoral economy.

The post-ancient phases are traditionally less investigated in this region, and this is even more evident along the coastal strip. Once again, the lack of detailed fieldwork studies has created an impressive void in the general knowledge almost until to the contemporary age. Another important goal of this project is to offer, as far as possible, particular attention to these periods.



## Methodology

The research project focuses on the use of non-invasive methodologies, combined with the sampling of surface ceramic material, according to the most widespread operational practice in traditional topographical and archaeological surveys. Field campaigns are aimed at obtaining new data about the sites by field-walling and remote sensing surveys, both terrestrial and airborne (drone). The approach to be adopted includes the analysis of historical cartography and archival aerial photographic images (e.g. those available in the historical archive of the Italian Military Geographical Institute); GNSS positioning and the completion of new plano-altimetric topographical surveys at a scale of 1:100 for each site, using imagery obtained from UAVs and photogrammetric models for documenting the elevations of significant portions (by state of conservation and/or construction elements) of the fortifications; acquisition, restitution and interpretation of multispectral images and LiDAR scans by UAVs; high resolution geophysical surveys with fluxgate differential magnetometry and optical pumping, GPR with different frequencies, ERT and electromagnetometry for sites or portions of sites that have sufficiently flat areas and relevant underground levels.

The sites undergoing analytical analysis will also be subjected to intensive archaeological surface survey, with the dual purpose of supporting and completing the photogrammetric survey and collecting a sampling of archaeological material, for a better and more precise chronological definition and, possibly, for a greater qualification of the identified topographic units (domestic spaces, warehouses, production areas, etc.). Considering that, apart from a few exceptions, most of the sites are completely unknown to the international archaeological literature, this quantitative information obtained from sampling the surface archaeological material, although characterised by “low definition” and not strictly linked to stratigraphic sequences, is fundamental for their historical and archaeological contextualisation. For a quicker but highly reliable documentation of the archaeological material collected, the purchase and use of specific optical (laser-based) scanning instruments for the graphic documentation of the profiles is envisaged.

The field survey provides for a phase of documentation and study of the defensive systems, with a precise focus on the constitutive morphological elements and the relationship of the enceintes with geomorphology, materials, and building techniques (extraction and building), in the light of broader comparison with similar studies on a Mediterranean scale. The typology of masonry, even considering the important limits highlighted by scholars, often continues to be the only element available to understand these structures, especially when minor sites are taken into consideration. Such an approach will be essential to set up a new atlas of the ancient building techniques employed in the region.

From its earliest stages, the project will be equipped with a Web-based information system organised on relational databases managed through the BraDypUS software, specifically developed for archaeological needs and continuously maintained and renewed since 2008. Thanks to a research agreement between the LAD, that is the Laboratory of Digital Archeology at Sapienza University (https://lad.saras.uniroma1.it) and the GARR Consortium, a cloud-based infrastructure of very high availability and performance is guaranteed in order to manage research data. The online database will be the main meeting hub between the various teams animating the project and the concrete place where it will be possible to carry out the integrated analysis of data collected by the various units. Part of this infrastructure will be available to the local authorities responsible for the management of cultural heritage, who will be able to use the data collected on the field in a profitable way and in real time, also for protection and of cultural development.


# Deliverables

For a constant sharing of the state of the project, the present website is thought to act as a platform for the communication and the dissemination: here it is possible to find the mission of the project, the methodologies used, the progress of the work, in ways that create interest and provide real-time updates to the scientific community, and trying to establish further contacts with any stakeholders. Furthermore, the website is also aimed at establishing profitable communication channels with local communities through the publication of content in an accessible form and language, informing and accounting for activities and collecting effective collaborations on multiple levels (reports, participation in activities, events, etc.). Therefore, the main purpose is to establish a productive dialogue with local communities, seeking for the difficult balance between knowledge production and protection of cultural heritage, on the one hand, and the right to exploit territorial resources on the other, today based essentially on a triangle formed by tourism, agricultural production and traditional pastoral activity.

As regards purely scientific results, in addition to participation in conferences, seminars, lectures, the publication of at least two scientific articles per year in A-grade journals, an international conference will also be organised where the main results will be exposed and discussed, whose proceedings will be published, in open-access and in English, in an editorial office of international interest. Then, the project aims at the realisation of the following products:

- Online georeferenced database, with multiple access levels, concerning the settlement, population and fortification model of coastal Chaonia, through a long chronological period that goes from the Iron Age to the threshold of the Modern age.
- Geographic database containing orthophotos, DEM and archaeological themes relating to the main sites subject to detailed analysis.
- Organisation of an international convention in order to share and discuss research results with the scientific community.
- Publication of a volume that conveys the results in a traditional format.
- Creation of a web portal with multiple access levels that can become a bridge between various approaches to cultural heritage, from the support for scientific research to the development of effective protection practices, and to the involvement of local communities in order to generate sustainable tourism.
