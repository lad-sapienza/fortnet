The FortNet Project is a joint collaboration between the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) and [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en) under the direction of [Enrico Giorgi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/enrico.giorgi/) and [Julian Bogdani](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/users/julianbogdaniuniroma1it), respectively, developed from [PRIN 2022](https://prin.mur.gov.it/Pages/Index/181) funding with the support of [European Union's NextGeneration EU](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/), the [Italian Ministry of University and Research](https://www.mur.gov.it/) and the [“Italia Domani” funding program](https://www.italiadomani.gov.it/).

Starting from October 2023 and for the next 24 months, FortNet will place at the centre of its research the coastal region of ancient Chaonia (Southern Albania), an area still quite marginal in current studies, mainly concentrated on the bigger urban sites such as _Phoinike_, _Antigonea_ and Butrint.

The coastal region has its own autonomy from a geographical point of view, since it is limited to the West by the rather steep Ionian coast, having few and quite difficult docking areas. The inland Acroceraunian Mountains, to use the ancient oronym, exceeding 2000 mt. of altitude, represent, on the other hand, a rather important geographical natural limit. Nonetheless, today, as in antiquity, one of the few possible routes connecting the bay of Vlora to that of Saranda passes along this ridge, while the inlands routes go through the narrow canyons created by those few streams flowing into the Ionian Sea. The sea has a double significance for a traditionally internal region such as Chaonia: it is, at the same time, both a risk factor and a connecting element. These two elements strongly determine the creation of a rather dense network of small settlements and fortifications of various types that occupy the hills overlooking the Ionian Sea.

These sites have been studied in the past very briefly, and in many cases no actual study exists or has been published. For the majority of them there is no archaeological and topographical documentation and for the rest only some sketches or rather generic descriptions are today available. The archaeological evidence seems to embrace an almost seamless long period of time that goes from the late Bronze Age to present times. For this reason, diachrony represents an essential research perspective for this project.
