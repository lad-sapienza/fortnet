# Deliverables of the FortNet project

For a constant sharing of the state of the project, the present website is thought to act as a platform for the communication and the dissemination: here it is possible to find the mission of the project, the methodologies used, the progress of the work, in ways that create interest and provide real-time updates to the scientific community, and trying to establish further contacts with any stakeholders. Furthermore, the website is also aimed at establishing profitable communication channels with local communities through the publication of content in an accessible form and language, informing and accounting for activities and collecting effective collaborations on multiple levels (reports, participation in activities, events, etc.). Therefore, the main purpose is to establish a productive dialogue with local communities, seeking for the difficult balance between knowledge production and protection of cultural heritage, on the one hand, and the right to exploit territorial resources on the other, today based essentially on a triangle formed by tourism, agricultural production and traditional pastoral activity.

As regards purely scientific results, in addition to participation in conferences, seminars, lectures, the publication of at least two scientific articles per year in A-grade journals, an international conference will also be organised where the main results will be exposed and discussed, whose proceedings will be published, in open-access and in English, in an editorial office of international interest. Then, the project aims at the realisation of the following products:

- Online georeferenced database, with multiple access levels, concerning the settlement, population and fortification model of coastal Chaonia, through a long chronological period that goes from the Iron Age to the threshold of the Modern age.  
  - [💾 Online database of the project (staff access only)](https://db.lad-sapienza.it/fortnet/)
- Geographic database containing orthophotos, DEM and archaeological themes relating to the main sites subject to detailed analysis.  
  - [🗺️ Access the web-based Archaeological Atlas (under development)](../atlas/)
- Organisation of an international convention in order to share and discuss research results with the scientific community.
  - [👩‍🏫 Workshop and conferences page](../workshop-and-conferences/)
- Publication of a volume that conveys the results in a traditional format.
  - [📚 Publications page](../publications/)
  - [🎤 Lectures and presentations page](../lectures-and-presentations/)
  - [👩‍🏫 Workshop and conferences page](../workshop-and-conferences/)
  - [🤝 Public engagement page](../public-engagement/)
- Creation of a web portal with multiple access levels that can become a bridge between various approaches to cultural heritage, from the support for scientific research to the development of effective protection practices, and to the involvement of local communities in order to generate sustainable tourism.
